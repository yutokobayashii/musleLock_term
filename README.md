# MuscleLock

**MuscleLock** is an iOS app designed to help users reduce smartphone overuse by combining app usage control with short physical exercises.  
Before accessing selected apps (e.g., YouTube, Instagram, TikTok), users must complete quick exercises such as squats, push-ups, or jumping jacks — creating a healthier balance between digital life and physical activity.
